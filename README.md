# HTML

- HTML stucture was used in the web system's interface and served as the foundation to organize content logically. It made it easier for users to navigate through the platform. Semantic HTML elements helped in conveying the purpose of different parts of the interface, improving accessibility for screen readers and serach engines. One enhancement I could think of is by adding more semantic elements such as article for displaying individual scores on the leaderboard.

# CSS

- CSS was used to style the web system by providing colors, typography, and overall layout for the web system. Using bootstraps' grid system and pre-defined classes help in making the process of styling the webpage easier and responsive therefore ensuring accessibility on both mobile and desktop devices. One improvement would be to implement more colors aside from primary colors to compliment with the theme and other aspects of the web system. Adding animations or transitions should also be considered to create a more engaging and better user experience.

# Javascript

- Javascript was implemented to handle the user actions by utilizing event listeners and DOM allowing dynamic responses to user inputs. For example, event listeners were set up for Start Game and Submit Answer which trigger specific functions that help the game proceed. Other functions, while does not have DOM still ensures a responsive and interactive experience for users as they use the website. One enhancement I can think of is to implement as system to pause the game after each round  to allow users to relax and comeback later to continue their progress. Also, implementing a system to change the background to indicate whether their answer is correct or not is also an enhancement I can think of.

# PHP

- PHP was utilized to manage score and player data by establishing a connection to the DATABASE using PDO. A file for the database connection was created separately to help standardize the system program. The PHP scripts were also used to handle various functionalities such as inserting data, creating table, and fetching data. Prepared statements were also used to prevent SQL injections. One enhancement I can think of is improving the error handling process of the system to provide a more user-friendly and less buggy program.
